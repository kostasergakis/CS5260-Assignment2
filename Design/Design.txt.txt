The design I went with was fairly simple. I gather the command line arguments to determine if the widgets
will be sent to s3 or DynamoDB. 's3' or 'ddb' are the valid options. The last argument is the name of the bucket. 
In the main function, I check for valid input, then start loop. In this loop, requests in the bucket are added to a list
(if there are any). If requests were added, I grab the first request in the list and then delete the request from the bucket.
Once I have the request object, I try converting it to a json object using the requests "Body" element. I then
create a variable called request_type to determine if request is a create, delete, or change request. I have three methods
that can be called from this point, widget_create_request(), widget_delete_request(), widget_change_request(). The delete and change 
methods will be implimented in the future. 

The widget_create_request() takes two parameters: storage_type and request_json. Storage_type is a string to determine 
where the widget should be sent. "s3" sends to s3, and "ddb" send to dynamodb. This method then sends the widget 
to the correct bucket (bucket 2).
